# hyde themes fork

This is my fork of the HyDE themes, that I tweaked for myself. They should work on any HyDE setup but if you are not me, you should probably not use them.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Personal theme repository, probably not for you.

> [!NOTE]
> These are not standalone themes, need [Hyprdots](https://github.com/prasanthrangan/hyprdots) installed...
